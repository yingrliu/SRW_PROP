Up till now, I have tried different version of PSO, none of them works
well for all the beamlines. The descriptions of the different versions are
briefly given as follows.

- **Version 1:** [Vanilla PSO]

    - The initial particles and their velocities are synthesized randomly.
    - random noise is added into the particle updating equations.  

- **Version 2:** [Partially Deterministic PSO]

    - Compared to version 1, remove the randomness in the particle updating
    equations.

- **Version 3:** [Fully Deterministic PSO]

    - Compared to version 2, further remove the randomness in the intial particles
    and the velocities. The initial particles are generated by adding some values
    to the minimum value of each dimension in tunable parameters. 
    - Therefore, the number of particles is now equaled to the dimensions 
    of the tunable propagation parameters.

All of them have closed performance. Therefore, only the version 3 is kept
in this repository.
